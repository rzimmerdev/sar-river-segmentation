# sar-river-segmentation
Segmentation of SAR images depicting rivers and running water bodies

The methods and network implemented in this project look forward to implementing the <cite>[clDice][1]</cite> loss function.

The final objective of the project is to segment and visually separate running bodies of water inside satellite images, considering the default method of acquiring these types of images: through synthetic aperture radars (SARs).
